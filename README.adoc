A tool for building dependencies of a Maven project from their sources during the build of the dependent Maven project.

A similar tool for building source dependencies of Gradle projects lives under https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps-gradle-plugin .
Contributions to support Ant, sbt and other Java build tools are welcome!

= What is this good for?

Source dependencies can help in situations, when the binaries of a dependency are not available in any remote
Maven repository. It may happen for various reasons, such as:

* The dependency project has not released yet because they release e.g. biweekly, but you want to develop and test your
  project on top of their changes continuously - in the most extreme case, you want to integrate each of their commits.
  This helps to find issues early and shorten your own delivery cycles.
* The dependency project has not released for whatever other reasons (other priorities, project discontinued, ...)
  but you still need to consume some commit from their branch.
* The dependency project is doing nasty things and you do not want to consume their binaries. You want to fork their
  source repository, cherry-pick only some of their commits and let srcdeps build out of your fork on the fly.

== `srcdeps` support for Maven

You need to use Maven 3.3.1+ to build a Maven project that has source dependencies.
As of `srcdeps-maven` version 3.2.0, a Maven project may depend not only on a source commit of another Maven project
but also on a source commit of a Gradle project.

The present solution for Maven is leveraging the concept of Maven Core Extensions introduced in Maven 3.3.1.
In particular, we provide an implementation of `LocalRepositoryManager` that delegates all the usual artifact
lookup work to the standard local repository manager available in Maven class path, but it is watching carefully,
if the requested artifact contains `-SRC-` in its version string. For such ones, the `srcdeps-core` library is
called, to build what is necessary and install it to the Maven Local Repository. In other words, the dependencies
are built and installed while they are looked up.

=== How to configure `srcdeps` for Maven

We provide a maven plugin that initializes srcdeps configuration files `.mvn/extensions.xml` and
`srcdeps.yaml`. Just run the following in the root directory of your project tree:

[source,shell]
----
mvn org.srcdeps.mvn:srcdeps-maven-plugin:init
----

While the resulting `.mvn/extensions.xml` will mostly be ready to use, the usefulness of the generated
`srcdeps.yaml` file depends strongly on the completeness of your dependencies' pom files. You should review
the generated `srcdeps.yaml` and adjust it manually.

See link:doc/srcdeps-maven-configuration.adoc[Srcdeps for Maven Configuration Guide] for more details about
`.mvn/extensions.xml` and `srcdeps.yaml`.

Note that all options configurable in `srcdeps.yaml` can be overriden through system properties passed on the command
line. See  https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps-core/tree/master/doc/srcdeps-yaml-runtime-overrides.adoc

=== Examples a.k.a. Quickstarts

There is a couple of ready-to-build self-contained examples in the
link:srcdeps-maven-quickstarts[srcdeps-maven-quickstarts] directory. Perhaps the most prominent of them are

* The link:srcdeps-maven-quickstarts/srcdeps-mvn-git-revision-quickstart[srcdeps-mvn-git-revision-quickstart] that
demonstrates how a Maven project can depend on a source revision of another Maven project.
* The link:srcdeps-maven-quickstarts/srcdeps-mvn-git-gradle-source-dependency-quickstart[srcdeps-mvn-git-gradle-source-dependency-quickstart]
which shows a Maven project can depend on a source revision of a Gradle project.


== How Srcdeps tools work

* Srcdeps tools are supposed to build dependencies with versions matching `{whatever}-SRC-{srcVersionType}-{srcVersion}`
* Any artifact having such a `-SRC-` version that is requested during the build needs to have an associated SCM
  repository in the configuration. The configuration is stored in `srcdeps.yaml` under the top level
  directory of the dependent project.
* The URL of the associated SCM repository is used to fetch the sources of the dependency and checkout the desired revision.
  The sources are cloned to `${maven.repo.local}/../srcdeps/${scmRepo.id}`
* Then, `srcdeps-core` changes the version in the sources to `{whatever}-SRC-{srcVersionType}-{srcVersion}`
  using `versions-maven-plugin` in case the dependency is a Maven project, or a piece of gradle script injected
  to `settings.gradle` if the dependency is a Gradle project.
* And finally, `srcdeps-core` builds the artifacts and installs them to the local Maven repository
* `-SRC-` dependencies are build only if they are not found in local repository - so they prolong the build only when
  upgrading.


== Source dependencies pointing at a branch

If you decide to depend on a branch by e.g.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.my-org.my-group</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-artifact</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.3-SRC-branch-my-special-branch</version>
</dependency>
----

then you need to know the following:

* `my-special-branch` is fetched at most once per JVM.
* Outer build containing the above snippet is one JVM and inner builds taking care for building `my-special-branch`
  or any other source dependencies are separate JVMs.
* Hence if you have two projects in your dependency hierarchy depending on
  `org.my-org.my-group:my-artifact:1.2.3-SRC-branch-my-special-branch` the two JVMs taking care for building it may
  clash by fetching two different states of the branch at two different points in time.
* `my-special-branch` is rebuilt only if its `HEAD` has changed with the last fetch.
* This means that if there is no clash, `my-special-branch` is built at most once per whole build set that includes the
  top level outer build and all its recursive inner builds. In other words, there is no rebuild if `HEAD` has not
  changed since the last build of the given branch.
* In case of a clash, the behavior is untested. In the worst case, the clashing JVMs may all fire builds that can
  bring the local Maven repository into an inconsistent state.

=== Legacy note

Originally, the present project provided a Maven plugin called `srcdeps-maven-plugin` that worked fairly well in
most situations, but it turned out soon that the Maven Plugin API is not rich enough to allow for catching dependencies
of all possible kinds. Most notably, the given project's parent pom and imports in `dependencyManagement`
sections were resolved by Maven even before the plugin was initialized. Thus, if the given project's parent pom had a
`-SRC-` version, the build failed with a missing artifact error message, simply because it happened before
`srcdeps-maven-plugin` could do anything. That's why we later chose the much more powerful Maven Core Extensions
API to implement `srcdeps` for Maven.
